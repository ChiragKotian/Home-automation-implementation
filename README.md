# Home Automation Project

IoT has left its mark in all parts of our life, but IoT devices generally tend to be expensive or come integrated with appliances which necessitate the replacement of 
older non-IoT components with newer IoT-enabled devices if one wants to utilise IoT devices. What if I said we can convert non-IoT devices to IoT ones using this project? Won't that be fun and good for the environment as it helps reduce e-waste?
